 * USB transfer protocol:
 *
 * CMD_START + 4 bytes => uint32_t length of data total
 * CMD_PAGE + 1 bytes + up to 256 bytes => uint8_t page length (0 == 256), page data
 * CMD_ABORT => Sent to indicate user requested to abort
 * CMD_STOP => Sent at the end of transfering all the data to indicate we think we've finished.
 *   Device replies with some data indicating the status of the flash device and if there are any remaining expected bytes.
 *
 * After sending each command, including CMD_STOP, the device must respond with the command code and a byte indicating whether
 * it could execute it correctly - 1 for OK, 0 for error.
